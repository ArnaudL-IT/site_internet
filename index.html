		<aside>I'm just another of those millenials, born in 1986, growing up in the 90's and passionate about too many things. I was born in the city of Caen (France) and raised a fdew kilometer west of it in a little town called Verson.<br/>
		I have a brother, Mickaël, who is exactly 14 months older than me. I went to pre-school with him in Venoix and elementary school in Verson. Like most kids of my age, I played soccer in a team but it didn't last very long. Things started to get interesting towards the end of elementary school when I learned how to play the drums. I was very enthusiastic about it at that time. After a year learning with a teacher at school, my parents enrolled me at the conservatory to play orchestral percussion. From then, it became uggly, solfège classes, dedication, and I actually played on a drum set only once in 7 years. In parallel, I was starting middle school, and found new interests: Weightlifting (Olympic lifting). I all began while going to "lutte" sessions, my sports teacher told me to enroll in the weightlifting training because I was so skiny. It wasn't long before I liked it, won my first challenge and 6 months later the french championships in my category (-50 kg). This went on for 4 years in a row, with a participation to the Youth European Championship during the summer 2001 before starting high school. At that point, I was still young and "inocent" but soon, like every teenager, I started experimenting the life of a high schooler, going out with friends and having fun. It lead me to drop conservatory which I wanted to quit since awhile ago.
		At school, I felt attracted by science, finally an explanation to all the little things that surround us. I was not one of the best student, not very focused and not too much into homework. But I managed to get my scientific Baccalaureat and decided to go to University despite the advices of my teatchers, telling me to fin d a short and applied formation. Apparently, I was not  destined for long studies anymore.<br>
		I stayed in the area for 26 years, until I finished my PhD in atomic Physics</aside>
